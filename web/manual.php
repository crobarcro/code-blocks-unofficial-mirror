<h1>Manual</h1>

<p>
There's an on-going effort to write a manual for using Code::Blocks. This is a
community-driven effort and contributions/criticism/suggestions are welcomed.
</p>

<p>
The initial documentation had started as an internal project of
<a href="www.hightec-rt.com">HighTec EDV-Systeme GmbH</a> who is now
making it yet another contribution to the community.
</p>

<p>
The documentation is provided in English and German, in PDF format.
More formats will follow soon.
</p>
