\section{Editor Tweaks plugin}\label{sec:editor_tweaks}

The EditorTweaks plugin contains several different features. On a per-file basis, it controls :

\begin{itemize}
\item word-wrap;
\item line-numbers;
\item tab key emissions (tab characters or spaces);
\item number of spaces the tab key emits;
\item end of line characters (carriage-return + linefeed; carriage-return; linefeed);
\item visibility of end of line characters;
\item on-demand striping of trailing white-space;
\item on-demand synchronization of end of line characters;
\item insert key suppression.
\end{itemize}

From the merge with the Aligner plugin, it has the ability to make sections of code more readable by aligning a specific character. For example, aligning the "=" in 

\begin{lstlisting}
int var = 1;
int longVarName = 2;
int foobar = 3;
\end{lstlisting}

will result in:

\begin{lstlisting}
int var         = 1;
int longVarName = 2;
int foobar      = 3;
\end{lstlisting}
