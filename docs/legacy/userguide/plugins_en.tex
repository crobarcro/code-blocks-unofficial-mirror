\chapter{Plugins}\label{sec:plugins}

Most of the plugins described ib this chapter are also in the Wiki. Texts and figures have been copied from the Wiki but adapted to be included in Latex documents (Miktex 2.9).

\section{General}

\codeblocks' features can be extend by using plugins. There are generally three types of plugins:
\begin{description}
\item[Core plugins:] developed and maintained by the core C::B team.
\item[Contrib plugins:] developed and maintained by the community and proven to be very valuable. So they are integrated into the C::B SVN.
\item[3rd party plugins:] developed and maintained by the community but not (yet?) in the C::B repository. Theses plugins often have their own repository or are being posted (including the source code) in the forums.
\end{description}

\textbf{If you are looking for plugins}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Look in the official release. Notice that the installer / package manager might require you to enable some of the plugins specifically. So READ carefully.
\item Search the forums for announcements, especially the forums at \url{http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php/board,14.0.html}.
\item There might be information on the Wiki concerning other plugins on this page and here : \url{http://Wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php/Announcement_for_plugins/patches}.
\end{enumerate}

For Windows users, the default behavior of the current installer does \textbf{not} install contrib plugins. You need to manually check the "contrib plugin" checkbox when asked for selected components to install. There is no way to install them manually afterwards.


\textbf{If you are developing plugins}: Surely you can work with plugin as you like, but here are some suggestions:

\tab Announce them in the plugin development board in the forums - including the (initial) source code.

OR

\tab Setup your own webpage (or use a file sharing platform) and post the link to the sources/binaries/svn access in the plugin development board in the forums.

OR

\tab Setup a repository, probably at BerliOS or SourceForge, post the link to the sources/binaries/svn access in the plugin development board in the forums. Notice: This is very convenient as attachments in our forum might be deleted from time to time. So it is not safe to post source code in the forums.

THEN

\tab Enter the plugins description on this page.

\tab Announce the plugin using this template on \url{http://Wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php/Template_for_plugin_announcement}
